%GETPTWEIGHTING
%   * PTIME the pilot tone signal over time with the channels in the rows and time along the columns.
%   * MST the indices defining the grouping.
%   * {NSTATES} the motion states. Note this is only used when there is an elliptical shutter.
%   * {PERCMAD} the percentile for relating the MAD estimator to the standard deviation of a Normal distribution.
%   * {ZSCOREOUTL} Z-score above which shots are detected as outliers.
%   * {USESVD} whether to use the Singular vectors to detect the outliers on.
%   * {NCOMPONENTS} the number of Singular vectors to remain for the analysis.
%   * {LOSSFUNCTIONINFO} a structure containing information about the loss  function for outlier detection
%   ** WEPT the soft weights from PT
%   ** OUTLWEPT indicating which state is an outlier detected from PT

%%% Coeffients to tweak
%   percMAD: bigger creates a smaller sigma for the Normal distribution
%   ZScoreOutl: making bigger will result in less outliers
%   lossFunctionInfo.delta: bigger will increase weights
